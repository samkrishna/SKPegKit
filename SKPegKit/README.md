# SKPegKit

This is a Learning exercise from itod's [PEGKit](https://github.com/itod/pegkit) and [TDTemplateEngine](https://github.com/itod/tdtemplateengine).

See those projects for their respective licensing (which is MIT).

## Motivation

This [pitch](https://github.com/apple/swift-experimental-string-processing/blob/main/Documentation/Evolution/RegexTypeOverview.md) about how to process regular expressions is starting to make the rounds in the Swift Standard Library Team. The pitch is, if I understand it correctly, basically around Swift Regexes being a form of Parsing Expression Grammars.

I figure I'd study his PEGKit code directly, since that's LITERALLY the name of it ("**P**arsing **E**xpression **G**rammars" Kit). So I'm hand-cloning his code to understand it better. And since TDTemplateEngine is a part of the mix, why not?

It's composed of two pieces:

- [PEGKit](https://github.com/itod/pegkit)
- [TDTemplateEngine](https://github.com/itod/tdtemplateengine)

This is a hand-clone of @itod's code, but fully ARC-ified. Consider all the code subject to the MIT license.
